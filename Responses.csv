Student care should handle the student's queries/concerns in a professional manner, by advising students on issues relating to their schedules, submission procedures etc, or by talking through any other issues students are having in general regarding the course. If necessary the student should be advised which of the other support pillars should be accessed if the situation warrants it.

","Student has regular scheduled meetings with their mentor regarding project design, mid-project check in and review before final submission. The student should be prepared for the meeting by bringing work they've already done for the relevant meeting.

Meetings should be more collaborative between the mentor and the student rather than the mentor advising exactly what the student should create for their project.",Students should be respectful and courteous to other students in order to create a positive community spirit. Students should be able to ask and answer questions relating to course and general coding related topics without fear of reproach. Ideally students should also be instrumental in increasing motivation in fellow students during their time on the course.  ,,,
